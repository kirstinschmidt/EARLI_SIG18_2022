# Evidence-Informed School Practice <i class="fas fa-school"></i>

---
## .phgreenlight[Evidence-Informed School Practice <i class="fas fa-school"></i>]

* Teachers are encouraged to consider a great variety of .phgreen[evidence] ranging from .phgreen[formal or informal generated raw data] to .phgreen[results of educational research] in their professional actions .em06[(European Commission of the European Communities, 2007; Schildkamp, 2019)].
<br>
<br>
<br>
* Both concepts, .phgreen[data-based decision-making] and .phgreen[research-informed educational practice], can be combined under the overarching approach of .phgreen[evidence-informed practice] .em06[(Brown et al., 2017; Brown et al., 2022)].
<br>
<br>
<br>
* Advantages of .phgreen[data-based decision-making] .em06[(Mandinach & Schildkamp, 2021)]:
<!-- Mit Ablürzungen DBDM & RIEP hantieren oder nicht? --> 
  * Individual data basis
  * Reactions to the subjective needs of the students as well as the specific school situations
<br>
<br>
<br>
* Advantages of .phgreen[research informed educational practice] .em06[(Bromme et al., 2014; Flood & Brown, 2020; Stark, 2017)]:
  * As an external input
  * Critical reflection on professional actions
  * Legitimation and justification of decisions
  
  
???
* Engaging with evidence: Demanded by researchers as well as politics
* formal (e.g. gradings) & informal data (e.g. observations into the classroom)
* both concepts can balance each other

* What we don't have in the data itself is a recommended action or the view from outside of the school.
* Data use can leave blind spots
* Advantages of RIEP -> uncover these blind spots
  - Because of research as an external input with higher objectiveness...
  - high credibility due to methodological conventions 
  
* Unfortunately there are some barriers making it harder for teachers to engage with evidence
 - like a lack of competences - data-literacy as well as research-literacy
 - not enough time during everyday practice
 - considering it as irrelevant, not useful, far away from their practical needs
* And there are some barriers concerning the correct interpretation, like cognitive biases

# Anchoring Effects  `r fontawesome::fa_i(name = "anchor")` 


---
## .phgreenlight[Anchoring Effects `r fontawesome::fa_i(name = "anchor")`]

* Anchoring = a numeric judgment is assimilated to a previous known standard .em06[(Mochon & Frederick, 2013; Tversky & Kahneman, 1974)]
<br>
<br>
* The effect occurs because of the .phgreen[scale distortion] caused by the anchor .em06[(Mochon & Frederick, 2013)]
<br>
<br>
* Some results of previous research:
  * Anchoring effects can be found even after a longer period of time .em06[(Mussweiler, 2001; Yoon & Fong, 2019)] 
  * Expertise does not necessarily prevent from Anchoring .em06[(Dünnebier et al., 2009)]
  * Relevant anchors lead to larger effects than random anchors .em06[(Röseler et al., 2022)]
<br>
<br>
* "A better understanding of these heuristics and of the biases to which they lead could improve judgments and decisions in situations of uncertainty". .em06[(Tversky und Kahneman, 1974, p. 9)]


???
- Example Anchoring: Participants in a study (LIT) were asked to estimate how old Ghandi became ... oder direkt Bsp. mit Bildungsbezug?
- The Anchoring effect has been studied for half a century - nevertheless are the mechanisms behind the effect not completely clarified
- There are different theories existing how anchoring occurs, for today only one conceivable theory, the scale distortion theory
- example scale distortion: if the target is to estimate the length of the Mississippi - with an given anchor of 70 Miles the length of 2000 miles seems far too long, but without this, 2000 miles are quite realistic

- in the long run, it's absolutely rational using Anchors as a helpful estimate
- but overcoming this influence leads to more precise estimations
- and when we want teachers to engage with evidence, data as well as scientific research, we need them to make precise estimations
- This leads to the quote of Tversky and Kahneman, whom have most prominently described anchoring effects...
- "A better understanding of these heuristics and of the biases to which they lead could improve judgments and decisions in situations of uncertainty" (Tversky und Kahneman, 1974, p. 9) -> like the Anchoring effect in the context of EIP

* DBDM and RIEP are supposed to be objective methods. 
<!-- Mit Abkürzungen DBDM & RIEP hantieren oder nicht? -->
* Both studies indicate evidence for anchoring effects on student teachers' engagement with different types of evidence. 

<br>

Anchoring effects in .phgreen[data-based decision-making]
* Benchmarks in national tests (e.g., statewide assessments) might act as an anchor for interpreting the achievement of one's own students resulting in different teaching practices
* E.g., teaching to the test .em06[(Garner et al., 2017)]

<br>

Anchoring effects in interpreting .phgreen[scientific evidence]
* Large-scale assessments (e.g., PISA) might act as an anchor resulting in a devaluation of scientific evidence based on smaller sample sizes 
* &rarr; sample sizes are not the only indicator of quality and validity

???
* "A better understanding of these heuristics and of the biases to which they lead could improve judgments and decisions in situations of uncertainty" (Tversky und Kahneman, 1974, p. 9) -> like the Anchoring effect in the context of EIP
* DBDM and RIEP are supposed to be objective methods -> important to know about still possible biases
* vermeintliche Objektivität dieser Methoden, aber auch hier kommen Verzerrungen ins Spiel -> wichtig zu wissen, um darauf eingehen zu können und sie möglicherweise sogar positiv wenden zu können
